Sleep, hunger, Social interaction



Are there tasks that can be made easier with an app?

Procrastination, entertainment, wasting your time



Are there existing apps that you think could be significantly improved

I don't use my phone for apps outside of communicating with friends or reading articles



Is there an underserved group of users who need an app?

No (Twilight imperium players)



Could emerging technology improve an app idea?

yes, however that is far beyond the scope of one person in five weeks





Write down three potential app ideas:

1. Twilight imperium simple combat simulator (shake phone to roll dice)
2. Cheap running accelerometer (use in-built accelerometer to help a person determine their running speed and acceleration)
3. Scottish country dancing manual, with camera recognition of a person's body movements to help with technique


Discuss with peers: 

1. Somewhat niche, but a fine idea
2. Perhaps a little boring and not something that would be found interesting immediately
3. Beyond scope of 5 weeks for a single person


Select an idea to develop further:

1. Twilight imperium combat simulator
