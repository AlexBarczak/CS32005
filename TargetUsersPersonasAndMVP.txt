TASK 4: Define your target users

The users of my app will likely be young adults and teenagers interested in a combination of board games and space fantasy and science fiction. 
Their occupation and tech skill level is likely to vary very widely from people who have no understanding of how to work a computer to tech gurus, the goal is to make the app accessible to all of them.
The pain points of the users are the issues we are trying to solve, make the game easy to join or leave and continue with no difficulty while making the user experience as seamless as possible.
They would be expecting a fun experience, challenging them to think about the tactical nuance in the puzzle of what actions to take and which choices may be best.
